    <h2>About DealX</h2>
    <p><strong>DealX – The Campus Reuse Hub</strong> started as a simple idea: help students access the tools and study materials they need without breaking the bank. Over time this idea grew into a community; students began to trust the platform and each other. Our mission is to make education affordable, accessible, and sustainable for every student.</p>

    <h3>The problem we saw</h3>
    <p>Across colleges, many essential items — drafters, roller scales, lab instruments, textbooks, project materials — are expensive. Students often buy these items only to use them for one or two semesters. The financial burden affects attendance in labs, quality of assignments, and overall confidence. Many talented students stop short of practical learning because they cannot afford the tools.</p>

    <h3>Why it matters</h3>
    <p>Education is not just theory; it requires tools and practice. When students lack basic equipment, learning outcomes drop. This is an equity problem — wealthier students find it easier to invest in tools, while others miss crucial hands-on experience. DealX aims to level this playing field.</p>

    <h3>How DealX helps</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Affordable access:</strong> Students can buy quality used items for a fraction of the new price.</li>
      <li><strong>Earn while you move on:</strong> Students selling items recover part of their costs.</li>
      <li><strong>Community first:</strong> Every transaction is between students — trusted and local.</li>
      <li><strong>Sustainable:</strong> Reuse reduces waste and supports a circular campus economy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Our vision</h3>
    <p>We envision campus communities where reuse is the norm — where students don't have to choose between learning and affordability. DealX will expand into more colleges, integrate secure payment options, and create verified listings so every student can shop and sell with confidence.</p>

    <h3>Values</h3>
    <p>Accessibility, sustainability, transparency and trust are at the core of everything we do. We build features that make it easy to list, find, and buy items securely.</p>
